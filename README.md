# Learning Markdown
A repository where I document my learning process of learning the Markdown language

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that converts text to HTML. In short, it helps to format text that appear on the screen.

## Why am I learning Markdown?
To improve  my proficiency in the **JAM stack** (JavaScript, APIs, Markup). It is a tech stack where the application logic typically resides in the client side, without being tightly coupled to the backend server.

## TBC
To insert more stuff once I learn Markdown from these references
